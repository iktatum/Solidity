# Solidity

## Smart Contracts in Blockchain

### Now that the Solidity contracts have been deployed, they serve three different functions.

    1. The first contract takes 3 people( addresses) and splits an amount into 3 equal parts and returns the remainder back to the owner (sender).
    
    2. The second contract takes an amount entered by the sender and splits the profits to three different execuitives ( ceo, cto and bob).
    
    3. Finally, the third contract allocates shares of a company via deferred compensation. The vesting schedule is such that the vesting occurs after 4 years. Human Respurces            owns the contract and cannot be changed by anyone other than the owner of the contract, Human Resources.
       The contract will be officially unlocked to execute the contract until jthe employee has reached the 1000 shares milestone, which represents the 4 years of vesting.
